# 3 - Sequential Multi-Agent Workflow: Code Generation Pipeline

This example demonstrates a sequential multi-agent workflow where agents collaborate in a fixed order to perform a task. The pipeline consists of three agents that work together to write, review, and refactor Python code.

## Workflow Overview

The process follows a clear, linear sequence:

1.  **User Input**: The user provides an initial request or specification for a piece of Python code.
2.  **Code Writer Agent**: Takes the user's request and generates the initial Python code.
3.  **Code Reviewer Agent**: Examines the code generated by the writer, checking for correctness, readability, and adherence to best practices. It produces a list of review comments.
4.  **Code Refactorer Agent**: Receives the original code and the review comments. It then refactors the code to address the feedback.
5.  **Final Output**: The final, refactored code is returned to the user.

This entire workflow is orchestrated by a `SequentialAgent`, which ensures that each sub-agent executes in the correct order, passing its output to the next agent in the chain via a shared state.

## Agents

### 1. `CodeWriterAgent`
-   **Description**: Writes the initial Python code based on the user's specification.
-   **Output**: `generated_code` (The Python code as a string)

### 2. `CodeReviewerAgent`
-   **Description**: Reviews the `generated_code` and provides constructive feedback.
-   **Input**: `generated_code`
-   **Output**: `review_comments` (A list of feedback points)

### 3. `CodeRefactorerAgent`
-   **Description**: Refactors the `generated_code` based on the `review_comments`.
-   **Input**: `generated_code`, `review_comments`
-   **Output**: `refactored_code` (The final, improved code)

## How to Run

This agent can be run using the ADK CLI. Provide a prompt describing the code you want to generate.

Example:
```bash
adk run "create a Python function that calculates the factorial of a number"
